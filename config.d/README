Configuration (*.json) files in this directory are merged into config.json.

The will be merged in the order that the OS returns them, in almost every case
this is ordered by name. This allows you to reorder them as you see fit by
naming them in this convention:
  * 00_loaded_first.json
  * 01_loaded_second.json
