# Usage as a library
Still writing the docs for this one, however as a rough outline -

  * var xi4n = require('xi4n') yields the following:
    - xi4n.insim
    - xi4n.outsim
    - xi4n.outgauge
    - xi4n.clientmanager
    - xi4n.logger
    - xi4n.product
  * See examples/ directory for some simple examples
  * See docs/ directory for the auto-matically generated documentation
